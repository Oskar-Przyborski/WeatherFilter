# [WeatherFilter](https://weatherfilter.netlify.app/)
WeatherFilter is a weather app, but with one additional feature - result filtering. You can select temperature or weather type and see matching results.
## Tools
I made this app with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and am using [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org) to get weather data.
